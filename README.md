# SpiralUp

Spiral up is an App to help Marginalized and Homeless Individuals find Shelter, Food and Opportunities. Using positive psychology and science to effectively help routines and opportunities for homeless people. We aim to be positive, but rub it against the constraints of reality and provide several pathways to attain the goal of a better future. Hence our slogan to “Spiral-UP” in life’s day to day.

## Dreaming up the app

Below you will see a few back of paper sketches of what where we zeroed-in on what the app would offer.

## And...More designs

We were convinced that we were on the right path, hence we digitized our design.

## MVP (Minimal Viable Product)

We managed to build what we set out to do, but the map features were not very powerful, because we were using an embeded map.

## THE Product

So we decided to take the challenge, and build our map ourselves, with the help of the Google Places API. This enabled us to fully customize how our map would display, and furthermore enabled us to provide our users with accurate searches.
